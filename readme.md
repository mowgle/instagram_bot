# Instagram bot - login and follow a user

This is an Instagram bot, coded in Python 3.7 that uses the Selenium package. 

It:
1. Logs in
1. Gets through all the annoying popups
1. Navigates to a user 
1. Follows them 

The variables *<ENTER_USERNAME>* and *<ENTER_PASSWORD>* need to be replaced with the user you wish to log in with.

This was created by following *jg-fisher*'s tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qcQDeShXpg).
